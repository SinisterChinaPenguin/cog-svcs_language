Hello, I would like to report a suspicious incident that I observed earlier today. I was walking my dog in the park and I noticed a car parked in the lot with its engine running and the windows tinted. The car had been there for over an hour and I could not see anyone inside. It seemed unusual to me, so I took down the license plate number: ABC-1234. I am concerned that this may be related to some criminal activity and I thought it would be important to report it. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
