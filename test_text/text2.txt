I was down the Old Cock Pub last Thursday just after I'd had my fish & chips. I was just having a quiet chat with my friend Bernard while we shared a pint on Old Murky & I heard Mick Fishy we call him the terminator talking to Dave Dangerous about sorting out some geezers down in Walford. They said they would meet up at the pink flamingo nightclub & see if they could catch them there. I've never been to the pink flamingo but I've heard it's well dodgy & I certainly wouldn't go there with my wife or even with Bernard. I know Dave works for Mikes Security Clamping during the week & he's pretty used to dealing with angry people, so I bet he'd get on OK there.
