Hello, I'm calling to report a suspicious vehicle in my neighborhood. There's a black sedan with tinted windows parked across the street from my house for the past two hours. I haven't seen anyone in or around the car, and it's not a vehicle that's normally parked in the area. I just wanted to let you know in case it's related to any ongoing investigations in the area. The license plate number is ABC 1234. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
