Hi, I have information that may be useful in an ongoing investigation. I witnessed a suspicious individual loitering around the back alley of the Tesco store on Main Road in Clapham last night at around 10 pm. He was wearing a dark hoodie and appeared to be meeting with the security guard at the back door of the store. He left the area quickly when he noticed me approaching. I was not able to get a clear look at his face or any identifying features, but I thought it was worth reporting. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
