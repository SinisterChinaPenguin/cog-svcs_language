Hello, I would like to report a suspicious incident that I witnessed earlier today. I was walking my dog in the park near the lake when I saw a man in a red truck who appeared to be attempting to steal a bicycle. The man was using a set of bolt cutters to remove the lock from the bike. I was able to get a clear look at the license plate number on the truck, which is ABC123. The man appeared to be in his late 20s, with short brown hair and was wearing a black jacket and blue jeans. He quickly fled the scene when he noticed me approaching. I thought it was important to report this incident to prevent further thefts. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
