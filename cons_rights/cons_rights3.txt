Used cars
Second-hand cars are consistently the most complained about product when it comes to consumer rights.

Traders and private sellers
If you bought from a trader, you’re covered under the Consumer Rights Act and the standard timeframes.

If buying from a private seller, you have fewer rights. This means that as long as the car was accurately described, you won’t be able to claim a refund.

Car brokers
Using a car broker is becoming an increasingly popular way to buy a car. You give the specifications of the car you want to a car broker, who will then deal with all the traders and dealerships to find you the best deal.

Under these conditions, and provided you meet the requirements set out, you might be covered under the distance seller element of the Consumer Contracts Regulations.

Section 75
Along with your rights under the Consumer Rights Act and Consumer Contracts Regulations, buying with your credit card can offer added protection for purchases between £100 and £30,000 under the Consumer Credit Act.

Transactions of any value on debit cards or pre-paid might be covered under a voluntary scheme called chargeback.
